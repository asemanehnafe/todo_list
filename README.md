# Django To-Do List Application

This project is a simple to-do list application built with Django. It allows users to log in, create and manage their to-do lists, add tasks with details such as titles, descriptions, due dates, and priorities, and share tasks with other users via short links. The project has been developed in three versions, demonstrating different approaches to Django views.

## Versions

### Version 1: Function-Based Views

This version uses traditional function-based views to handle the requests and render templates.

### Version 2: Generic Views

This version refactors the application to use Django's generic views, simplifying the code by using pre-built view classes for common tasks.

### Version 2-2: Class-Based Views

This version further refines the application by using class-based views (CBVs) to provide a more organized and reusable approach to handling views.
